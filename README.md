# com_facilities
This Google Map extension built for Joomla will allow you to list facility locations on a map, provide a list of details and a connection to a Joomla article.

Uses coordinates to gain best accuracy for each facility location. Use our geocoder tool here to make it as easy as possible to find those latitude / longitude coordinates.

Some facility location ideas:

* Cemeteries
* Airports
* Bus stops
* Cab / Taxi stops
* Storage facilities
* Multiple office locations
* Ambulance / Fire / Police stations
* School campuses
* University campuses
